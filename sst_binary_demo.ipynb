pretentious.', 'With few respites, Marshall keeps the energy humming, and his edits, unlike those in Moulin Rouge, are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it.', 'Light-years ahead of paint-by-number American blockbusters like Pearl Harbor, at least artistically.', 'One of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre.', 'All
