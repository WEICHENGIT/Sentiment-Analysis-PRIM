# Sentiment Analysis
#### WEI Chen, Pierre-Yves Casanova

In this repository We provide a [jupyter notebook API](https://github.com/WEICHENGIT/Sentiment-Analysis-PRIM/blob/master/Sentiment%20Visualization%20%26%20Opinion%20Generation%20Tool.ipynb) where you can do the sentiment visualization and opinion generation based on the mLSTM model from the OpenAI paper [Generating Reviews and Discovering Sentiment](https://github.com/openai/generating-reviews-discovering-sentiment).

The implementation is based on work from [@guillette](https://github.com/guillitte/pytorch-sentiment-neuron) and [@NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA/sentiment-discovery).

Python Requirements:

    Python 3.5
    Pytorch 0.3.0
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    unidecode

We also include our full version [report](https://github.com/WEICHENGIT/Sentiment-Analysis-PRIM/blob/master/report%20v2.0.pdf) in this repository, in which you may have a deep vision on how the model works behind this application and the technical details.
